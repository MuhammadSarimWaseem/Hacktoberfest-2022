### How to push code into the repository
 - There are three folders in this repository namely Algorithms, DataStructures and Projects.
 - If your code is related to algorithms, go in the Algorithms folder, go to the folder with the name of the programming language your code is written in, if it doesn't exist, just create the folder and go into it and put your file into that folder.
 - If your code is related to Data Structures, go to the DataStructures folder, make a new folder with the name of your DataStructure if it doesn't exit, if it already exits just go to that folder, in that folder make another folder with the name of the programming language your code is written in and finally in that folder, commit your changes.
 - If you have an entire project to commit, just go to the Projects folder and push your project folder into that folder.
